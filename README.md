# Community Art and Collaborative Modding
Many of our Rimworld modding community members have either artistic talent or coding talent, but not both; this repository is intended to help us work together to create a better Rimworld.

This is not a mod! It's a storage solution for "anyone can use this" art, and a hub for artists+modders to collaborate in a way that allows *anyone* to contribute, regardless of which direction their skills lie in, or how much time they have. It will also allow us to search for art, or make art requests, in an interface that makes all of that easy to find again.

For now, at least, this GitHub Repository is not a place for non-modders to propose mod ideas. Theoretically, that might be possible later, but it will depend heavily on how the project organization/workflow comes together.

# Tentative guidelines (subject to change, as we work through this and determine what works for the community and what needs improvement):

ART:

1. Art can be uploaded into the appropriate folders. The folder structure roughly mirrors how things are organized in the Core Defs.
2. Please only upload art you're happy to have other people use without needing to ask.
3. Please don't upload other people's art without their explicit permission/request for help.
4. In each folder, there is a "CREDITS.txt" folder. When you add art, please update this file with who you are and what you made. This will allow coders to credit you for the art, as well as allow folks in general to find you if they have questions, requests, or just want to tell you how much they love your work.
5. If you're not comfortable with GitHub, you can post your art in the forum thread, and I or someone else can upload+credit for you.
6. If you just want to put the art out there, no need to do anything more. Folks can browse the repository any time they like.
7. If you'd like your art to be given life sooner rather than later, you can bring attention to it by creating an Issue. Please use the subject line to give a brief description/name of what you've made, and attach the "Code Request" label.
8. Since one of the goals of this repository is to host All The Arts, please try to collect as many of your similarly-themed creations in one Issue as possible. For example, if you've made a lot of herbs, please make one issue titled "Cooking Herbs", rather than separate issues for parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme...
9. If you have ideas for what your creation should do, please include them. For example, "I think it's pretty silly that Lavish Meals waste food. Can we make a third Food category, for 'herbs and spices', and create a Lavish Meal recipe that uses meat + plant + herbs, with no waste? Here's some herb art I've made."

ART REQUESTS:

1. Art requests can be made by creating an Issue. Please use the subject line to give a brief description/name of what it is you're making that needs art, and attach the "Art Request" label.
2. Please collect as many of your similarly-themed creations in one Issue as possible. As above, if you've coded cooking herbs but you need art, please make one "Cooking Herbs" issue, rather than separate issues for parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme...
3. Please describe what your mod does. A list of the specific things you need art for is REQUIRED, but a general description of what you're trying to do could produce spinoff ideas. For example, somebody could write back with, "Oooh, here, I made you a cinnamon! It only grows in tropical biomes."
4. If you have placeholder art that might display a rough idea of what you're aiming for, include it in your issue.
5. If your mod is downloadable somewhere, please provide links. This could be links to the mod download and/or a forum post discussing it.

RESULTANT COLLABORATIONS:

1. It is totally cool to continue to use the Issues to discuss art/code/ideas that are cascading out of the original question, _as long as you are still open to community-wide input_. If you find that you've come to a point where you're happy working with the people you're working with on this project, and you're not looking for more, please close the issue and spin your project off into its own space.
2. This repository is not the place to store any mods made as a result of the collaborations started here. When you're at a point that you want a place to host the actual mod, please spin that off into its own space. It's cool to continue the conversation here; throw the "Mod In Infancy" label up on it. If you're closing the issue but you're still looking for/open to more collaborators, please leave a link/contact information at the end of the issue and add the "More collaborators welcome" label.
